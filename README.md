### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Giovanni Minelli, welcome to my GitHub page!

I'm a software developer with a passion for coding and new technologies. I have a degree in computer science from the University of Bologna and I'm currently pursuing a master in Artificial Intelligence. My focus of study is **Machine vision** and **Reinforcement learning**, and I look forward to doing research and development in these fields.

In the meantime? I code. Being a programmer is great because you can basically do everything with just your own skillset. Enjoy my code playground and have fun!

You can also find my works here in a tidier format [johnminelli.it](https://johnminelli.it)

## Get to know me better:
I've always wanted to know a little bit of everything so that I could span different topics without necessarily being overwhelmed by the volume of information. I think having a great history of experience in many topics has helped me to be more flexible in many situations even outside of the tech world.
Over the years I experienced the field of mechanical industry with CNC machines 2.5/3 axes, electrical hobby including components soldering, and play around with Arduino/Adafruit/Raspberry (check out my repositories on IoT, those are part of my thesis for which I collaborated with an Eclipse foundation development team (y)). I found myself very interested in 3D modeling with even basic experiments in Unity3D. Crypto/blockchain follower (just the technology behind it) since early 2016 and supporter of decentralized opensource solutions.

I really like the hardware and the architectural side of a computer but being the code development more accessible and straightforward for a kiddo I embraced this world where elegance and order reigns (...well, the "it works" exists but I'm not a fan :)).\
Just to name a few languages (of the many I've experimented with) I really enjoy writing mobile apps in **Kotlin** but today I'm fully deep into Machine Learning and AI integrations in **Python** (Keras, TF,Pytorch, Numpy, Scikit Learn, OpenCV, ...).

## Something more?
I'm a big believer of the "mens sana in corpore sano" creed: I'm not an **A**thlete but I regularly attend the gym and fitness training classes.
I also love cinema and the whole making of industry behind it (that's also why computer vision is so appealing to me :))


I'm always looking for new challenges, so feel free to leave questions or suggestions and, please don't hesitate to contact me.
Thanks for visiting!
