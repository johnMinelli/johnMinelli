###  Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Giovanni Minelli, welcome to my GitHub page!

I'm a software developer with a passion for coding and exploring new technologies. I recently graduated with a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Bologna, specializing in Machine Vision and Reinforcement Learning. And because apparently, I haven't had enough of training neural networks that stubbornly refuse to converge, I've decided to embark on a PhD in Robotics focusing on Reinforcement Learning. Yes, I now spend my days teaching robots through trial and error â€“ mostly error, if we're being honest! ðŸ¤–ðŸ’«

My interest in AI research extends to the study of multi-joint embedding spaces, perception, and vision applied to robotics. I find this field fascinating, particularly its connections with neuroscience, and I'm eager to explore and contribute to its development.

## Get to know me better:
I've always been encouraged to learn diverse subjects because you never know when that knowledge might prove useful. As a result, I've gained experience across many fields, which I believe has made me more adaptable in both life and the tech world. Over the years, I've worked in the mechanical industry with 2.5/3-axis CNC machines and explored electrical hobbies, including component soldering. I've also tinkered with Arduino, Adafruit, and Raspberry Pi (check out my IoT repositories, which were part of my thesis project where I collaborated with an Eclipse Foundation development team). I've developed a keen interest in 3D modeling, even experimenting with Unity3D. Additionally, I've been following crypto/blockchain technology (not for investment purposes) since early 2016 and support decentralized, open-source solutions.

While I really like the hardware and architectural aspects of computers, code development was more accessible and straightforward for a young enthusiast, that's why I embraced this world where elegance and order reign (...okay, we all try our best ðŸ™‚). Among the many languages I've experimented with, I particularly enjoy writing mobile apps in **Kotlin**, but today I'm fully immersed in Machine Learning and AI development using **Python** (Keras, TF, PyTorch, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, OpenCV, ...).

## Something more?
I'm a firm believer in the "mens sana in corpore sano" philosophy. I love cinema and the entire 'making of' industry behind it (which is also why computer vision is so appealing to me).

I'm always looking for new challenges, so feel free to leave questions or suggestions, and please don't hesitate to contact me. Have fun!
