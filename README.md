### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Giovanni Minelli, welcome to my GitHub page!

I'm a software developer with a passion for coding and exploring new technologies. I recently graduated with a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Bologna, specializing in Machine Vision and Reinforcement Learning.

My interest in AI research extends to the study of multi-joint embedding spaces, perception, and vision applied to robotics. I find this field fascinating, particularly its connections with neuroscience, and I'm eager to explore and contribute to its development.

I strive to stay updated with research by participating in ML reading groups and contributing to open-source communities such as [RL community](https://farama.org/).
You can find my works here or on [johnminelli.it](https://johnminelli.it) presented in a more organized format.

## Get to know me better:
I've always been encouraged to learn diverse subjects because you never know when that knowledge might prove useful. As a result, I've gained experience across many topics, which I believe has made me more adaptable in life and the tech world.
Over the years, I've worked in the mechanical industry with 2.5/3-axis CNC machines and explored electrical hobbies, including component soldering. I've also tinkered with Arduino, Adafruit, and Raspberry Pi (check out my IoT repositories, which were part of my thesis project where I collaborated with an Eclipse Foundation development team). I've developed a keen interest in 3D modeling, even experimenting with Unity3D. Additionally, I've been following crypto/blockchain technology (not for investment purposes) since early 2016 and support decentralized, open-source solutions.

I really like the hardware and the architectural side of a computer but being the code development more accessible and straightforward for a kid I embraced this world where elegance and order reigns (...okay, we all try at our best ðŸ™‚).\
Just to name a few languages (of the many I've experimented with) I really enjoy writing mobile apps in **Kotlin** but today I'm fully deep into Machine Learning and AI integrations in **Python** (Keras, TF, Pytorch, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, OpenCV, ...).

## Something more?
I'm a big believer of the "mens sana in corpore sano" creed, I love cinema and the whole 'making of' industry behind it (that's also why computer vision is so appealing to me)

I'm always looking for new challenges, so feel free to leave questions or suggestions and, please don't hesitate to contact me. Have fun!
